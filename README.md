# OllamaSharp Demo - No:2

In this demo an attempt was made to get to scrape all of the publicly available data, that was could be added to the Digital WorkMate chatbot
It does answer questions, regarding the the product, but not as someone from the company, but more as a "someone" who just has a general idea of what they do
It can also answer general questions, which are not related to the system, however it is a satisfactory start, since we know it can be fed this kind of general data.
